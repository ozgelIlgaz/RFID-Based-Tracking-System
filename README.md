# RFID-Based-Tracking-System
In this project We made a tracking system that can be used in places where many devices are used (like warehouses, hospitals, or factories etc.). RFID readers which have been placed on doors, are reading the tags on devices, and sending the data to main computer then this data goes to a website which people can access. This way we can keep track of which rooms the devices are in. This project contains four RFID readers, one Arduino UNO, one NodeMCU Development Card, nine NFC cards, one breadboard and some jumper wires. 
Arduino code takes the data from hardware and sends that data to the NodeMCU code.
NodeMCU code takes that data and sends that to the website.
